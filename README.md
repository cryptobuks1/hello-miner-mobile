# Miner Sample App iOS

This small smaple iOS app has been created to demonstrate the power of using Heroku for easily and continously developing, integrating, and deploying web applications â€” particularly in concert with Salesforce. It integrates with the [hello-miner-app](https://github.com/frankcaron/hello-miner-app) light-weight node backend.
